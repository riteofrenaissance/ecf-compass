## Scoring and Results

### What do my scores mean?

Your results include three separate scores:

**Sovereignty (S)**: 1-10 scale (higher = better)
- 8-10: Strong autonomy
- 6-7.9: Moderate autonomy
- 4-5.9: Vulnerable
- 1-3.9: Heteronomous (external control)

**Obsession (O)**: 1-10 scale (lower = better)
- 1-3.9: Healthy engagement
- 4-5.9: Mild obsession
- 6-7.9: Moderate obsession
- 8-10: Severe obsession (intervention needed)

**Growth (G)**: 1-10 scale (higher = better)
- 8-10: Thriving
- 6-7.9: Growing
- 4-5.9: Stagnant
- 1-3.9: Declining

### What is a "profile archetype"?

Based on your three scores, you're classified into one of **8 archetypes** (e.g., "Sovereign Grower," "Dependent Learner," "Captured Mind"). These archetypes help you quickly understand your relationship pattern with AI.

**Learn more**: [User Guide - Profile Archetypes](guide.md#profile-archetypes)

### Are there "good" and "bad" scores?

There are **healthy and concerning patterns**, but no judgment:
- **Healthy**: High Sovereignty, Low Obsession, High Growth
- **Concerning**: Low Sovereignty, High Obsession, Low Growth

The goal is **awareness and improvement**, not shame.

### How do I improve my scores?

Each assessment provides **personalized recommendations** based on your specific profile. These include:
- Immediate actions (Week 1-2)
- Short-term protocols (Month 1-3)
- Long-term strategies (3-12 months)

**Detailed interventions**: [SOG Manual - Intervention Protocols](sog-manual.md#intervention-protocols)

### My scores fluctuate a lot. Is that normal?

Yes! Scores can vary based on:
- **Life circumstances** (stress, workload)
- **Context of use** (work vs. personal)
- **Recent changes** (new AI tools, behavioral shifts)

Focus on **long-term trends** rather than individual assessments. Sudden dramatic changes may warrant deeper investigation.

## Conceptual Questions

### Is AI use always bad?

**No!** The SOG framework is **not anti-AI**. Our position:

✅ **Healthy AI use**:
- Maintains your autonomy
- Enhances your capabilities
- Serves your authentic goals

❌ **Problematic AI use**:
- Undermines your independence
- Creates dependency
- Serves system metrics over your flourishing

**Key principle**: AI should be a **tool you control**, not a force that controls you.

### What if I have high obsession but also high growth?

This is the **"Dependent Learner"** profile. You're benefiting from AI but at the cost of autonomy. This pattern is:
- **Common** (~20% of users)
- **Risky** (growth may not be sustainable)
- **Addressable** (sovereignty-building interventions)

**Recommendation**: Focus on sovereignty enhancement *while* maintaining growth practices.

### Can AI ever be sovereign?

This is a philosophical question! In the SOG framework:
- **AI systems** are tools, not moral agents
- **Sovereignty** is a human capacity (autonomy, self-determination)
- **AI cannot be sovereign** in the Kantian sense (no rational self-legislation)

However, AI can be designed to **respect and enhance human sovereignty**.

### How does this relate to "AI safety"?

**AI safety** typically focuses on preventing AI harm (misalignment, existential risk).

**Cognitive sovereignty** focuses on preserving human autonomy and flourishing in AI interaction.

Both are important and complementary:
- AI safety: "Will AI harm humanity?"
- Cognitive sovereignty: "Will humanity remain autonomous?"

### Is this based on real science?

Yes! ECF Compass is built on:
- **Philosophical foundations** (Kant, Hegel) - centuries of rigorous thought
- **Psychological research** (self-determination theory, addiction science)
- **Empirical validation** (pre-registered studies, peer review)

**All research is open**: [Zenodo Repository](https://zenodo.org/communities/riteofrenaissance)

## Philosophical Questions

### Why Kant and Hegel specifically?

These philosophers provide:
- **Kant**: Rigorous foundation for human dignity, autonomy, and moral obligation
- **Hegel**: Framework for resolving contradictions through synthesis

Together, they offer unparalleled depth for understanding human-AI relationships.

**Deep dive**: [Philosophy Guide](philosophy.md)

### Isn't this just philosophy, not science?

ECF Compass integrates **both**:
- **Philosophical rigor**: Clear ethical principles and logical consistency
- **Scientific validation**: Empirical testing, psychometric analysis, peer review

The strongest frameworks combine both traditions.

### What about other ethical frameworks (utilitarianism, virtue ethics)?

We primarily use Kantian deontology and Hegelian dialectics, but the SOG framework is **compatible with multiple ethical perspectives**:
- **Utilitarian**: Maximizing well-being through sovereignty
- **Virtue ethics**: Cultivating practical wisdom in AI use
- **Care ethics**: Maintaining relationships and interdependence

**Our stance**: Kantian framework provides the strongest foundation for cognitive sovereignty specifically.

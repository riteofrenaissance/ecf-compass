## Step 1: Understand Cognitive Sovereignty (30 seconds)

### What is Cognitive Sovereignty?

**Cognitive sovereignty** means maintaining control over your thinking and decision-making when using AI systems.

Think of it like this:

| 🚫 Without Sovereignty | ✅ With Sovereignty |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| AI decides what you see | You choose what to explore |
| You rely on AI without thinking | You use AI as a tool for thinking |
| Can't function without AI | Can thrive with or without AI |
| AI shapes your goals | You use AI for YOUR goals |

**The Goal**: Use AI powerfully while staying in control of your life.

```
Example Result:

Sovereignty (S): 7.2 / 10  →  Strong
Obsession (O):   3.4 / 10  →  Healthy (lower is better)

## Common Questions

### How accurate is a 5-minute assessment?
The Quick Assessment provides a **reliable snapshot** but the Standard Assessment (15 min) offers more nuanced insights. For clinical or research purposes, we recommend the Deep Dive.

### What if my scores seem wrong?
Assessment relies on honest self-reflection. If scores surprise you:
1. Consider if you're being fully honest
2. Ask a trusted friend for their perspective
3. Retake in a different context or time
4. Remember: Denial is common in dependency patterns

### Do I need to share my results?
**No!** Your data stays private by default. Sharing is entirely optional and can be done anonymously if you choose to contribute to research.

### What if I need professional help?
If your assessment shows **severe obsession** (O > 8) or significant life interference, consider consulting a therapist who specializes in technology-related concerns. ECF Compass is a screening tool, not a replacement for professional care.

### How often should I reassess?
- **During intervention**: Weekly (Quick Assessment)
- **Regular monitoring**: Monthly (Standard Assessment)
- **Comprehensive review**: Quarterly (any type)

## A

### Agency
The capacity to act independently and make free choices. In the context of AI interaction, agency refers to maintaining control over one's decisions rather than being passively directed by algorithmic recommendations.

*See also*: [Autonomy](#autonomy), [Sovereignty](#sovereignty)

### AI (Artificial Intelligence)
Computer systems designed to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, pattern recognition, and decision-making.

### Algorithmic Capture
A state where an individual's attention, behavior, or decision-making becomes predominantly shaped by algorithmic systems, reducing independent thought and action.

*See also*: [Cognitive Capture](#cognitive-capture), [Heteronomy](#heteronomy)

### Archetype (Profile)
One of eight distinct patterns of human-AI relationship identified by ECF Compass based on SOG scores. Examples include Sovereign Grower, Dependent Learner, and Captured Mind.

*See also*: [SOG Framework](#sog-framework)

### Assessment
A structured evaluation tool that measures cognitive sovereignty through questionnaires and scoring systems. ECF Compass offers Quick (5 min), Standard (15 min), and Deep Dive (30 min) assessments.

### Aufhebung
A Hegelian concept meaning simultaneously to cancel, preserve, and elevate. In ECF Compass, it describes how the Cyber Constitution addresses human-AI relationships by negating problematic patterns while preserving benefits and achieving higher synthesis.

*See also*: [Hegelian Dialectic](#hegelian-dialectic), [Synthesis](#synthesis)

### Autonomy
The capacity for self-governance and independent decision-making. In Kantian philosophy, autonomy means giving laws to oneself through reason rather than being ruled by external forces or impulses.

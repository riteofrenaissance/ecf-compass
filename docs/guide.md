## Understanding Your Assessment

### The SOG Framework Explained

ECF Compass evaluates three interconnected dimensions:

#### 🛡️ Sovereignty (S)

**What It Measures:**
- Autonomy in decision-making
- Control over AI interactions
- Awareness of influence mechanisms
- Ability to disconnect or refuse AI suggestions

**Key Questions:**
- Do you feel in control when using AI systems?
- Can you easily stop using AI when you choose to?
- Do you understand how AI influences your decisions?
- Are you aware of alternative approaches to AI-assisted tasks?

**Scoring:**
- **High (7-10)**: Strong autonomy and self-determination
- **Medium (4-6)**: Moderate control with some vulnerabilities
- **Low (1-3)**: Significant autonomy concerns

---

#### ⚠️ Obsession (O)

**What It Measures:**
- Compulsive usage patterns
- Emotional dependency
- Cognitive capture by AI systems
- Impact on non-AI activities

**Key Questions:**
- Do you feel anxious when unable to access AI tools?
- Do you check AI systems more frequently than intended?
- Has AI usage interfered with other important activities?
- Do you think about AI systems even when not using them?

**Scoring:**
- **High (7-10)**: Significant dependency requiring intervention
- **Medium (4-6)**: Moderate patterns worth monitoring
- **Low (1-3)**: Healthy, controlled engagement

---

#### 🌱 Growth (G)

**What It Measures:**

- Meaningful progress toward goals
- Enhanced capabilities
- Personal flourishing through AI

**Key Questions:**
- Have you developed new skills through AI interaction?
- Do AI tools help you achieve meaningful goals?

**Scoring:**
- **High (7-10)**: Strong positive development
- **Medium (4-6)**: Some growth but room for improvement
- **Low (1-3)**: Limited or negative development patterns

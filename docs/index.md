# 🧭 ECF Compass

## Interactive Cognitive Sovereignty Assessment Tool

Welcome to **ECF Compass** - an interactive assessment system for evaluating and enhancing cognitive sovereignty in human-AI interactions.

---

## 🏛️ Part of the Cyber Constitution Framework

ECF Compass is a practical implementation of principles established in the [Cyber Constitution](https://cyber-constitution.netlify.app/), providing real-time assessment and guidance for maintaining cognitive sovereignty in AI-mediated environments.

## 🎯 Mission

To provide individuals and organizations with practical tools for:

- **Assessing** cognitive sovereignty in AI interactions
- **Identifying** patterns of dependency and autonomy loss
- **Implementing** evidence-based interventions
- **Monitoring** progress toward sovereign human-AI relationships

## 🧬 The SOG Framework

ECF Compass implements the **Sovereignty-Obsession-Growth (SOG)** assessment model:

### Three Dimensions

**🛡️ Sovereignty (S)**  
Measures autonomy, control, and self-determination in AI interactions. Evaluates the degree to which users maintain agency over their cognitive processes and decisions.

**⚠️ Obsession (O)**  
Assesses dependency patterns, compulsive behaviors, and cognitive capture. Identifies warning signs of unhealthy attachment to AI systems.

**🌱 Growth (G)**  
Tracks personal development, skill acquisition, and meaningful progress. Evaluates whether AI interactions contribute to human flourishing.

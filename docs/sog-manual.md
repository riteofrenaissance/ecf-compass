## Introduction

### Purpose of This Manual

The **SOG Manual** provides comprehensive protocols for assessing cognitive sovereignty in human-AI interactions. It is designed for:

- **Clinical practitioners** evaluating technology-related concerns
- **Researchers** conducting studies on human-AI interaction
- **Organizations** implementing ethical AI practices
- **Individuals** seeking structured self-assessment
- **Educators** teaching digital literacy and AI ethics

### What is the SOG Framework?

SOG is a **three-dimensional assessment model** that evaluates:

1. **Sovereignty (S)** - Autonomy and self-determination
2. **Obsession (O)** - Dependency and compulsive patterns
3. **Growth (G)** - Personal development and flourishing

Together, these dimensions provide a comprehensive profile of an individual's relationship with AI systems.

### Philosophical Grounding

The SOG Framework is rooted in:
- **Kantian ethics** - Autonomy, dignity, categorical imperative
- **Hegelian dialectics** - Synthesis, *Aufhebung*, progress through contradiction
- **Contemporary psychology** - Self-determination theory, behavioral assessment

For detailed philosophical background, see [Philosophy Guide](philosophy.md).

## Theoretical Foundation

### The Three Dimensions Explained

#### Why These Three Dimensions?

The SOG framework emerged from analyzing the fundamental tensions in human-AI relationships:

**Sovereignty** addresses the question: *Who is in control?*
- Derived from Kantian autonomy
- Measures self-determination
- Evaluates agency preservation

**Obsession** addresses the question: *Is this relationship healthy?*
- Identifies dependency patterns
- Measures compulsive engagement
- Evaluates cognitive capture

**Growth** addresses the question: *Is this beneficial?*
- Assesses meaningful development
- Measures capability enhancement
- Evaluates authentic flourishing

### Dimensional Relationships

The three dimensions are **interconnected but distinct**:

```
High Sovereignty + Low Obsession + High Growth = OPTIMAL
High Sovereignty + Low Obsession + Low Growth = UNDERUTILIZED
Low Sovereignty + High Obsession + High Growth = DEPENDENT LEARNER
Low Sovereignty + High Obsession + Low Growth = CAPTURED
```

### Measurement Philosophy

SOG employs a **mixed-methods approach**:

1. **Quantitative scales** - Numerical scores for comparison
2. **Qualitative indicators** - Behavioral patterns and context
3. **Longitudinal tracking** - Changes over time
4. **Contextual assessment** - Domain-specific evaluations

---

## Assessment Methodology

### Assessment Types

#### Quick Assessment (5 minutes)
- **Items**: 15 questions (5 per dimension)
- **Purpose**: Rapid screening
- **Use case**: Initial evaluation, regular check-ins

#### Standard Assessment (15 minutes)
- **Items**: 45 questions (15 per dimension)
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive evaluation
- **Use case**: Full assessment, research studies
- **Reliability**: High (r = 0.89)

#### Deep Dive Assessment (30 minutes)
- **Items**: 90 questions + open-ended responses
- **Purpose**: Detailed analysis with qualitative data
- **Use case**: Clinical evaluation, intervention planning
- **Reliability**: Very high (r = 0.94)

### Administration Guidelines

#### Preparation
1. **Environment**: Quiet, distraction-free space
2. **Time**: Ensure uninterrupted assessment period
3. **Mindset**: Encourage honest, reflective responses
4. **Context**: Consider recent AI usage patterns (past 30 days)

## Sovereignty (S) Dimension

### Definition

**Sovereignty** measures the degree to which an individual maintains **autonomy, control, and self-determination** in AI-mediated environments.

### Theoretical Basis

Rooted in **Kantian autonomy** - the capacity to give laws to oneself rather than being governed by external forces (heteronomy).

**Key Concept**: A sovereign individual:
- Makes deliberate choices about AI engagement
- Understands AI influence mechanisms
- Can disconnect or refuse AI suggestions
- Maintains alternative non-AI capabilities

### Sub-Dimensions

#### 1. Decisional Autonomy (DA)
**Definition**: Freedom to make choices without AI coercion

**Assessment Items** (5-point Likert scale):
1. I make my own decisions even when AI suggests alternatives
2. I feel free to ignore AI recommendations when I choose
3. I control when and how I use AI systems
4. My choices reflect my values, not AI optimization
5. I can easily stop using AI when I want to

**Scoring**:
- **High DA (4-5)**: Strong decisional autonomy
- **Moderate DA (2.5-3.9)**: Some vulnerabilities
- **Low DA (1-2.4)**: Significant autonomy concerns

---

#### 2. Influence Awareness (IA)
**Definition**: Understanding of how AI shapes thoughts and behaviors

**Assessment Items**:
1. I understand how AI systems try to influence me
2. I can identify when AI is shaping my decisions
3. I know the difference between my own thoughts and AI suggestions
4. I recognize persuasive design patterns in AI interfaces
5. I am aware of the data AI uses to personalize my experience

**Scoring**:
- **High IA (4-5)**: Strong metacognitive awareness
- **Moderate IA (2.5-3.9)**: Partial awareness
- **Low IA (1-2.4)**: Limited insight into AI influence

---

#### 3. Capability Maintenance (CM)
**Definition**: Preservation of skills independent of AI assistance

**Assessment Items**:
1. I regularly practice tasks without AI assistance
2. I maintain skills that AI could perform for me
3. I know how to accomplish tasks without AI tools
4. I intentionally preserve my independent capabilities
5. I balance AI use with skill development

**Scoring**:
- **High CM (4-5)**: Active skill preservation
- **Moderate CM (2.5-3.9)**: Some atrophy risk
- **Low CM (1-2.4)**: Significant skill erosion

---

### Sovereignty Total Score

**Calculation**: Average of DA, IA, and CM scores

**Interpretation**:
- **8-10**: **Sovereign** - Strong autonomy and self-determination
- **6-7.9**: **Moderately Sovereign** - Generally autonomous with vulnerabilities
- **4-5.9**: **Vulnerable** - Significant autonomy challenges
- **1-3.9**: **Heteronomous** - External control dominates

---

## Obsession (O) Dimension

### Definition

**Obsession** measures **dependency patterns, compulsive behaviors, and cognitive capture** by AI systems.

### Theoretical Basis

Drawing from:
- **Behavioral addiction research** - Compulsive use patterns
- **Kantian heteronomy** - Being ruled by external forces
- **Clinical psychology** - Dependency indicators

**Key Concept**: Obsession represents the **loss of voluntary control** over AI engagement.

### Sub-Dimensions

#### 1. Compulsive Usage (CU)
**Definition**: Inability to control frequency or duration of AI interaction

**Assessment Items**:
1. I use AI more frequently than I intend to
2. I have difficulty limiting my AI usage
3. I find myself reaching for AI automatically
4. I use AI even when I don't really need to
5. I feel compelled to check AI systems repeatedly

**Scoring**:
- **High CU (4-5)**: Severe compulsive patterns (intervention needed)
- **Moderate CU (2.5-3.9)**: Some compulsive behaviors (monitoring advised)
- **Low CU (1-2.4)**: Controlled, voluntary usage (healthy)

**Note**: *Higher scores indicate MORE problematic obsession*

---

#### 2. Emotional Dependency (ED)
**Definition**: Psychological reliance on AI for emotional regulation

**Assessment Items**:

4. I choose AI interaction over other meaningful activities
5. My AI usage has caused problems in important life areas

**Scoring**:
- **High IL (4-5)**: Severe life interference (clinical concern)

- **Low IL (1-2.4)**: Minimal disruption (integrated healthily)

---

### Obsession Total Score

**Calculation**: Average of CU, ED, and IL scores

**Interpretation** (Note: Higher = More problematic):
- **8-10**: **Severe Obsession** - Immediate intervention recommended
- **6-7.9**: **Moderate Obsession** - Active monitoring and intervention advised

- **1-3.9**: **Healthy Engagement** - No significant dependency concerns

---

## Growth (G) Dimension

### Definition

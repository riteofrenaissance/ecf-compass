## 📖 Overview

**ECF Compass** is an evidence-based assessment tool that helps individuals evaluate and enhance their **cognitive sovereignty** in AI interactions. Built on rigorous philosophical foundations (Kantian ethics and Hegelian dialectics) and validated through empirical research, it provides actionable insights for maintaining healthy, productive relationships with AI systems.

### What is Cognitive Sovereignty?

**Cognitive sovereignty** is the capacity to maintain autonomy, dignity, and self-determination while engaging with AI systems. It ensures that humans remain **ends-in-themselves** rather than mere means to technological optimization.

## 📐 The SOG Framework

ECF Compass evaluates three interconnected dimensions:

### 🛡️ Sovereignty (S)
**Autonomy and self-determination in AI interactions**

- **Measures**: Decisional autonomy, influence awareness, capability maintenance
- **Goal**: Maintain control over your cognitive processes
- **Range**: 1-10 (higher is better)

### ⚠️ Obsession (O)
**Dependency patterns and compulsive behaviors**

- **Measures**: Compulsive usage, emotional dependency, life interference
- **Goal**: Avoid unhealthy attachment to AI systems
- **Range**: 1-10 (lower is better)

### 🌱 Growth (G)
**Personal development and flourishing**

- **Measures**: Skill development, goal achievement, cognitive enhancement
- **Goal**: Ensure AI serves genuine human flourishing
- **Range**: 1-10 (higher is better)

## 🏛️ Philosophical Foundation

ECF Compass is grounded in two complementary philosophical traditions:

### Immanuel Kant (1724-1804)
- **Categorical Imperative**: Universal moral principles
- **Formula of Humanity**: Humans as ends, not means
- **Autonomy**: Self-legislation vs. heteronomy

### Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770-1831)
- **Dialectical Method**: Thesis → Antithesis → Synthesis
- **Aufhebung**: Canceling, preserving, and elevating
- **Master-Slave Dialectic**: Recognition and self-consciousness

**Synthesis**: The [Cyber Constitution](https://cyber-constitution.netlify.app/) framework

**Deep dive**: [Philosophy Guide](https://ecf-compass.readthedocs.io/philosophy)
